# neuralNetworkIris
A neural network which classifies the famous [iris dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) and uses backpropagation to train the network. The purpose of this project was to learn about implementing a neural network.

## Knowledge Resources

Links to resources which were helpful for the construction of the network. Additionally, I received help from friends who have already successfully built neural networks. Their help was invaluable for the progress made with the network.

- [Neural Network Training Using Back-Propagation.](https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2013/09/01/neural-network-training-using-back-propagation.aspx) An article discussing a network constructed in C# which classifies the iris data set.

- [Neural Net in C++ Tutorial.](https://vimeo.com/19569529) Helpful general tutorial on the construction of neural networks. The structure of this project draws heavily from the one presented in the video.

- [Back Propagation Tutorial](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs9417ml/MLP2/) Decent tutorial describing the implementation of back propagation which contains pseudocode.
