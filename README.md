# neuralNetworkIris
A neural network which classifies the famous Iris Data Set and uses backpropagation to learn.

## Knowledge Resources

Links to resources which were helpful for the construction of the network.

- [Neural Network Training Using Back-Propagation.](https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2013/09/01/neural-network-training-using-back-propagation.aspx) An article discussing a network constructed in C# which classifies the iris data set.

- [Neural Net in C++ Tutorial.](https://vimeo.com/19569529) Helpful general tutorial on the construction of neural networks. The structure of this project draws heavily from the one presented in the video.
